<h2 className='my-6 text-center'><i>Adopt and Care For Bunnies!</i></h2>

<p className= 'my-10'><b>Bunnies are gentle, social creatures that make excellent pets. They require a balance of companionship, a proper diet, and a safe living environment to thrive. Bunnies are herbivores and typically enjoy a diet of hay, fresh vegetables, and rabbit pellets. They are also quite playful, so it is important to provide them with toys and activites to keep them entertained.</b></p>

<p className= 'my-10'> To learn more about bunnies and how to care for them, including their dietary needs, behavior, and health tips, visit reputable pet care websites or consult with a local veterinarian. Many resources are available online to help you become an informed and repsonsible bunny owner. I highly recommend checking out the <a href="https://www.pethealthnetwork.com/all-pet-health/small-animal-health-care/bunny-care-101" target="_blank"><i className='hover:bg-fuchsia-200 underline' >PetHealthNetwork</i></a> for additional information.</p>
